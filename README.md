Let's try to have a working dev env back

Would be awesome to be able to accept collaborative pull requests too !

## Roadmap

- Fix bugs and annoyances
- Welcome pull requests (propositions) and merge the ones that make sense, if
  any
- Work on a REST API
- Gargaj and anybody else are as welcome as before

Nothing revolutionnary here, I don't see any breaking change happening soon,
data included.

At the same time:
- Gargaj and his collaborators can take their time working on 2.0 the way he
  intended to do it, openly or not
- If any change happens to the data on 1.0, he'll be able to track the changes
  on github, again if it happens, it will surely be minor stuff
- Once he feels is code his ready, he can open a pull request on github
- We review/test his code together and merge it
- We all contribute to Gargaj's 2.0, with his opinion obviously weigthing more
  than anyone else's, as he built it
- When Gargaj or any other contributor wants to quit, nothing will change and
  other people will still work on the site
